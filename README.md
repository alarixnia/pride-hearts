Pride heart emoji
=================

If you've used [the fediverse](https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse/), you've
probably seen a lot of instances with pride heart emoji. Some instances also
have extras not found in the original set (e.g. :heart_lesbian:).

I wanted to recreate the set, with a broader selection of flags, each one with
uniform shape, minimal fuzziness, and clearly labelled as reusable, modifiable,
and redistributable.

All are 128x114. Higher resolution versions could be easily made if there's a
clear need.

Some hearts are derived from public domain and creative commons flag SVGs
from Wikimedia Commons and Openclipart.

Flags consisting of coloured stripes in a certain order might not fall under
copyright depending on your jurisdiction.

You can use, redistribute, and modify these freely, including redistributing
modified versions. You can use these on your Fediverse instance, forum, or
chosen chat software, as well as anywhere else you fancy. I don't care if
you credit me or not.
